02.11 Trouble-shooting:

On adroit:
1. When running slurm script, run through relative path. Use srun when running parallel, otherwise it causes convergence problem. 
2. Added compiling flag -ldl to link dynamic libraries.
3. Reorganized the Makefiles. 
To-do: 
wave.slurm script fails to run from /scratch/jiarongw/...
Set PATH variables in ./bashrc and add "module load mpi" as well.
Explore the possibility to code output directory into the source code. The question is how to change the function of basilisk like save().

On tiger:
1. -I{BASILISK} flag should be placed behind the {SRC_FILE}. It includes the basic basilisk header files. For graphic libraries, it is more important to add the linking path than the including path. {OPENGLINC} name should be changed to avoid confusion.
