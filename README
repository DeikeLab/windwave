02.11 Trouble-shooting:

On adroit:
1. When running slurm script, run through relative path. Use srun when running parallel, otherwise it causes convergence problem. 
2. Added compiling flag -ldl to link dynamic libraries.
3. Reorganized the Makefiles. 
To-do: 
wave.slurm script fails to run from /scratch/jiarongw/... [FIXED]
Set PATH variables in ./bashrc and add "module load mpi" as well. [DONE]
Explore the possibility to code output directory into the source code. The question is how to change the function of basilisk like save().

On tiger:
1. -I{BASILISK} flag should be placed behind the {SRC_FILE}. It includes the basic basilisk header files. For graphic libraries, it is more important to add the linking path than the including path. {OPENGLINC} name should be changed to avoid confusion.

02.12 Trouble-shooting

1. NOTICE: /scratch/netid only exists on the particular head node you are using.
Must use /scratch/network/netid on adroit and /scratch/gpfs/netid on tiger.
2. Better not to use _ when naming the directory. Still haven't figured out a good way to put the strings together.

1. Modified contains the result from the new source code where the vertical kinetic energy is taken into account. Linear contains where the whole profile is set to a linear shape.

1. Found that the way time unit is calculated now cannot be generated to cases where k is not equal to 2pi. Should use T = 2pi/sqrt(kg) instead. Changed that under /tiger/linear
